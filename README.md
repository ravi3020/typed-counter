# Typed Counter App 🧮⚛️

A simple yet meaningful **React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS** project built as part of my learning journey.  
This app helped me understand **typed state, event handling, UI styling, and deployment** from scratch.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Typed Counter App** is a small counter application that allows users to:
- Increment the count
- Decrement the count
- Reset the count to zero

While the functionality is simple, the focus of this project is on:
- Writing **type-safe React code**
- Using **modern tooling**
- Understanding **real-world deployment**
